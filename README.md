- 👋 Hi, I’m @jackmisner
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I went from managing an award-winning homebrew shop in Brooklyn to becoming a software engineer, and I'm building an app that combines both passions!
- 👀 I’m a recent career switcher who is interested in full-stack development, data analysis and lists of exactly 3 things apparently. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about non-relational databases, RESTful APIs and UX/Front-End design as I work on my full-stack homebrewing app [BrewTracker](https://www.github.com/jackmisner/brewtracker) (contributions welcome)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to data visualization, brewing/fermentation tracking, or my other hobby/passion which is record collecting.
- 📫 How to reach me: jack.misner@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-d-misner/). I'm always happy to chat about anything over a beer!
